Only write the enterances you want in a Google Spreadsheat with links to media, like images, video, sound, etc, and follow the instructions on their website for help with publishing. You then get an iframe-link that you can embedd on your website, blog or send as a link. <br> This tool has been used by large and respected companies like <a href="http://world.time.com/2013/12/05/nelson-mandelas-extraordinary-life-an-interactive-timeline/">Times</a> and <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/timeline-egypt-inturmoil0.html">Al Jazeera</a>. </p> </div> </div> <div class="dipity-wrapper"> <div class="timeline" id="dipity"> <div class="info-container" id="dipity"> <h3>dipity.com</h3> </div> <div class="dipity_embed"> <iframe width="100%" height="400" src="http://www.dipity.com/andberg/Louise-Bourgeois_1/?mode=embed&z=0#tl" style="border:1px solid #CCC"> </iframe> <p style="margin:0;font-family:Arial,sans;font-size:13px;text-align:center"><a href="http://www.dipity.com/andberg/Louise-Bourgeois_1/">Louise Bourgeois</a> on <a href="http://www.dipity.com/">Dipity. </a> </p> <p> The second timeline is made with Dipity.com, a timeline-tool that borders on a social media-tool. It wants to be used by social media and spread by social media. Anyone can add events on a timeline that is open for the public, comment specific events or the timeline in general. You can follow users and "like" events. You can also see the entries on a map - where in the world did they take place - or as a list or a flipbook. Dipity seems to be good in that way if you want more interaction with your timeline, but it is harder if you only want to tell your story. And tell it in a stylish way. </p> </div> <br> </div> </div>
